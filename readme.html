Container Parameters<br>
mkdir ./mule<br>
export CONNECTALL=./mule; export INSTALLER=ConnectAll_Unix_2_8_3_R67dc0c2b_64.sh ; export VERSION=2.8.3.11; docker-compose -d up<br>
<br>
Environment Variables<br>
<ol>
	<li>CONNECTALL - A local folder to store the mule executable. If this is not provided a volume called "mule" will be created for storage.<br>
	<li>CONNECTALL_HOME - A local folder to store the ConnectAll data, eg, mapping data. If this is not provided a volume called connectall_home will be created for storage.<br> 
	<li>TOMCAT - A local folder to store the Tomcat executable. If this is not provided a volume called tomcat will be created for storage.<br> 
	<li>MYSQL - A local folder to store the ConnectAll database, eg, user account and record id maps. If this is not provided a volume called mysql will be created for storage.<br> 
	<li>INSTALLER - REQUIRED The connectAll installer provided to you by sales@connectall.com.<br>
	<li>VERSION - REQUIRED The tag that will be applied to the created images. The version of the installer is a good idea, eg, 2.8.3.11.<br>
	<li>WEB_PORT - the port that Tomcat and the ConnectAll user interface is on. The default is 8080.<br>
	<li>PUSH_PORT - The port mule will listen on for messages pushed from an application. This is usually not needed as ConnectAll will poll for any changes in your applications. The default is 7070<br>
	<li>GENERIC_PORT - The port mule will listen on to enable a generic (ie custom) application for synchronization. The default is 8090.<br>
	<li>ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD_PORT -  ConnectAll can synchronize entire attachments or just the url. This is the port that mule will honor attachment download requests. The default is 60000.<br>
	<li>RENDERER_PORT - You can develop custom renderers to view remote application data. This is the port that mule listens on to honor this request. The default is 8098.<br>
</ol>
<br>
Volumes<br>
	<li>muleÂ - Where the data for the application is stored unless you provide a local folder using the CONNECTALL environment variable<br>
	<li>connectall_home - Where the mapping data is stored unless you provide a local folder using the CONNECTALL_HOME environment variable<br>
	<li>tomcat - Where the tomcat executable is installed unless you provide a local folder using the TOMCAT environment variable<br>
	<li>mysql - Where the database is stored unless you provide a local folder using the MYSQL environment variable<br>
<br>
Built With<br>
	<li>MySql:5.6 for the database image<br>
<br>
Limitations<br>
	<li>The dashboard feature has been fixed in the ConnectAll 2.8.4.2 build. Be sure to install this or a later version.<br>
	<li>Additional nodes (i.e. a cluster) cannot be spawned at this time but multiple containers (i.e. a vertical partition) can be started using different ports and file storage.<br>
